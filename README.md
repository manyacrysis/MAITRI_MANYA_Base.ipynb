  ABSTRACT 
 
 
Maintainability of software is an essential component that must be considered when evaluating 
the quality of certain types of software. It describes the simplicity with which several 
maintenance actions can be performed to make software flexible to the modification of the 
environment. 

The availability of a large variety of ML methods for data analysis, as well as 
their expanding popularity, is another source of inspiration for projecting this maintainability. 
A comprehensive examination and comparison of several different ML-based boosting 
algorithms (BAs) for SMP is provided here. The aim of this work is to investigate the potential 
of ML-based categorisation techniques to enhance software maintainability, with an emphasis 
on meeting security criteria. 

In this study, the Dataset of Studentsâ€™ Software Projects 
Requirements (DOSSPRE) dataset is used, which is acquired from the Mendeley repository. 
For the binary dataset, the RF and Voting Classifier models were utilized, while for the 
multiclass dataset, the RF and AdaBoost models were employed. 

For the binary dataset, the 
Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 88.78%, while the Voting Classifier showed 
slightly lower but solid results with 87.53% accuracy. The RF model demonstrated strong 
performance with a 98.97% accuracy in the multiclass dataset, demonstrating its versatility in 
meeting a range of criteria. The AdaBoost model also performed well on the multiclass dataset 
with 96.59% accuracy. The two datasets were best handled by RF, which benefited from crucial 
preparation and data balancing procedures.
